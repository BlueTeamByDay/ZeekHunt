cat conn.log | zeek-cut uid id.orig_h id.resp_h duration | sort -nr -k4 | head -n 5
This ^^ will display the top 5 connections by duration. From here, we grab the UID of the top connection and grep out the full connection details. For me, the top connection is labeled

DNS queries longer than 25 character and see how many times they show up (splunk needed)

httplog ==> user-agent strings --> look for the 100 least common agents on the network. Probably 2-3 will be malware, look for shell commands, etc.
